# Implementation
    Everything works, I am really tired, I just go to the gym, we are team 69 we deserve full
    We pass all tests
    Code is a little messy, but it works
    All written code is in map.c file
    proc.c was modified to hold wmap info
    trap, exit, and fork all call functions in map.c
    given wmap.h file modified to hold more mapping info
